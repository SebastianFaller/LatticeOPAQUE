\paragraph{More funny combiner ideas}
One could try these (more or less sensible) ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hash the output of two OPRFs. Should not change much to xors
    \item Sequential execution. Output of one OPRF is input to the other. (Doesn't sound good)
    \item One round of Feistel.
\end{itemize}
